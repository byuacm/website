	<h4>Service</h4>
	<p>
		We are all blessed with talents and abilities and now BYU ACM is providing opportunites to use those to help others!  At least once a semester we have our Weekend of Code service project where
		we all get together and work on a project.  There is always food and we all learn a lot about a new programming paradigm or language we weren't familiar with before.
