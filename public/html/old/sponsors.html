		<h4>2013 Contribution Model</h4>

		<p>At each meeting, we invite a company to give a 15 minute presentation and provide food and prizes for attendees. This has been an excellent way for companies to connect with our members and get involved with recruiting at BYU. For each meeting, we do the following for the company that will present:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Include the company’s logo and name in our weekly email reminder.</li>
			<li>Include the company’s logo and name in our weekly posted fliers around the Computer Science department.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>BYU ACM functions on the support given to us by companies that we work with. There is no given contribution price level or requirement. Every semester we do the following for companies that have contributed to our club for that semester:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Place the company's logo on our shirt for that semester.</li>
			<li>Place the company's logo on our website.</li>
			<li>Put signs out for the company during the career fair identifying them as BYU ACM supporters.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Please Contact Kimberly Orton in the CS department at kimberly@cs.byu.edu for more information.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="less-defined">Please keep in mind that your company is not required to give a contribution to BYU ACM in order to arrange an information session or other on-campus event with the Computer Science department. These events are publicized generally to CS undergraduate students and the CS department at BYU is happy to help you in arranging these events. The CS department also provides a job board where employers are always welcome to post Computer Science-related jobs (cs.byu.edu/jobs).</p>
