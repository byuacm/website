            <h1> 2013 ACM Rocky Mountain Regional Programming Contest </h1>

            <p> BYU is proud to be a host site for the 2013 Rocky Mountain Regional ACM Contest. </p>

            <p> This competition is part of a larger contest, and registration is required.  For information about this competition or to register, please see the Rocky Mountain Region Contest Information page. (http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/finder/rocky-mountain-2013) </p>

            <h3> Contest Site Information </h3>

            <p> Detailed maps and pictures are available <a href="https://cs.byu.edu/department_information"> here </a>. </p>

            <p> The contest will be held in basement of the Talmage Building (TMCB).  <a href='http://map.byu.edu/'>Here</a> is a map of the campus, just search Talmage to find the building.  You can park in the lot immediately north of the Talmage, or the larger lot a little further north, free after 6:00 PM on Friday and all day Saturday.  (Do not park in reserved spaces, or in the police parking close to the small lot). </p>

            <p>Check-in is at the banquet Friday evening, in the Talmage Building during practice time, and in the Talmage Building on Saturday. </p>

            <h3>Contest Schedule</h3>

            <p>Most sites in the region have a pizza party on Friday night (at the practice contest), and a banquet on Saturday.  Since many teams have a long drive ahead of them on Saturday, we invert this schedule.  We have a welcome banquet for meeting the competition on Friday night, and a pizza party immediately after the contest on Saturday (so that we can conclude earlier).</p>

            <p>This schedule is subject to change - specifically, if the region advances the time of practice session, we'll hold the banquet earlier.</p>

            <h3> Friday and Saturday Details </h3>

            <p>The Friday banquet will be held in the Wilkinson Student Center in room 2142 (see campus map from link above) from 5:30 PM - 6:45 PM. All teams are encouraged to come, but I recommend arriving by 6:15 PM.  There is plenty of parking located directly east of the Wilkinson Student Center. We recommend not parking too far sound of the Student Center as Friday is a BYU football game day.</p>

            <p>The Wilkinson Student Center is very close to the Talmage Building and you can easily walk from one to the other. The Talmage Building is on the east side of the road, right next to the small booth and crossing arms leading to underground parking. The computer labs are in the basement of the west side of the building.</p>

            <p>The official practice time will be on Friday after dinner.  The regional judges will operate their servers and contestants will be given a few practice problems that parallel the format of the actual problems on Saturday.  All teams are strongly encouraged to attend.  This gives you a chance to debug your input/output techniques prior to the contest.  If you are unable to come to dinner, please check in with us in the west lobby area of the Talmage Building after 7:00 PM Friday. </p>

            <p>Teams may also check in on Saturday morning, but you'll miss the official practice time.  Your team must check in by 9:30 AM on Saturday, October 26. </p>

            <p>The contest runs from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and is sometimes slightly extended for fairness purposes.  For competition details, please see the ACM site.</p>

            <p>Because many teams drive a long distance to arrive, I have moved the restaurant dinner to Friday night and kept the post-contest activities to a minimum.  Note that on Saturday we will likely finish our pizza before the official results are known - we'll have a small drawing (with fun prizes) and then announce the results.</p>

            <h3>Coaches</h3>

            <p>There are no official coach activities this year. During the competition coaches are welcome to briefly photograph their teams (with an escort), but should remain outside of the competition areas otherwise. We are working on scheduling a nice tour of BYU campus for any interested coaches. Please let us know if you are interested in that.</p>
